      description: `
       As a Full Stack Developer at <a href="https://emm-it.de/" target="_blank">EMM-IT</a>, I am leading the development of a software application for  <a href="https://aero-bildung.de/de/ueber-aero-bildung/" target="_blank">Aero Bildung</a>, designed to manage the training courses for pilot candidates. This application enables the efficient organization and tracking of courses undertaken by pilots, including the management of certification details. My role extends beyond leadership; I am deeply involved in the hands-on development of the application.

      I personally contribute to both the backend and frontend aspects of the project, coding in Java with Hibernate and Spring Boot to build a robust and scalable backend. On the frontend, I utilize Angular to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Additionally, I work with MSSQL for database management, ensuring accurate and reliable record-keeping of certifications and other essential data.
      While I oversee the development process, coordinate the team’s efforts, and ensure successful delivery, I also take pride in being directly involved in the technical implementation. `,

I implemented web scraping techniques to extract vehicle information from Autoscout24 and integrated it seamlessly into the client's site using EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates). I also designed a user-friendly interface and ensured real-time data synchronization, which significantly enhanced the dealership’s online presence and improved its overall functionality.

      I chose to use a JSON file on the server for data storage, given the project’s minimal database needs. I also set up a cron job to automatically perform the data extraction at regular intervals, ensuring that the vehicle information remains up-to-date without requiring manual intervention.`,
